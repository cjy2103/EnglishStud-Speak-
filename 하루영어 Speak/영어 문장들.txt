Q. Hello, could you please introduce yourself?


A.

Nice to meet you. I live in Busan, a beautiful city by the sea.


I am currently living in a studio apartment for about three years, and working as an Android app developer.


Although I am still a novice developer with insufficient skills, I am making efforts to reach a higher level of proficiency.

﻿
Q.

What do you do after work, and do you have any hobbies?

​

A.

After work, I spend my time studying development-related topics and posting about them on my blog.

​

My hobby these days is to find various music on YouTube.

​

When coding, it can sometimes become boring and listening to music helps me block out external noise and focus better.

​

That's why i enjoy finding new and frequently listen to music.

Do you exercise? I think basic physical strength is important for developers

I agree with you.

For developers, basic physical strength is very important.

I usually trained my basic physical strength by taking a walk or doing home training.

But I haven't been able to exercise for more than a week because I've been doing something else.

﻿From now on, I will make time to do home fitness after work.
