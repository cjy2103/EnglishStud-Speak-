Q. Hello, could you please introduce yourself?


A.

Nice to meet you. I live in Busan, a beautiful city by the sea.


I am currently living in a studio apartment for about three years, and working as an Android app developer.


Although I am still a novice developer with insufficient skills, I am making efforts to reach a higher level of proficiency.
