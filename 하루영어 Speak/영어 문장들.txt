Q. Hello, could you please introduce yourself?


A.

Nice to meet you. I live in Busan, a beautiful city by the sea.


I am currently living in a studio apartment for about three years, and working as an Android app developer.


Although I am still a novice developer with insufficient skills, I am making efforts to reach a higher level of proficiency.

﻿
Q.

What do you do after work, and do you have any hobbies?

​

A.

After work, I spend my time studying development-related topics and posting about them on my blog.

​

My hobby these days is to find various music on YouTube.

​

When coding, it can sometimes become boring and listening to music helps me block out external noise and focus better.

​

That's why i enjoy finding new and frequently listen to music.

Q.

Do you exercise? I think basic physical strength is important for developers

A.

I agree with you.

For developers, basic physical strength is very important.

I usually trained my basic physical strength by taking a walk or doing home training.

But I haven't been able to exercise for more than a week because I've been doing something else.

﻿From now on, I will make time to do home fitness after work.



Q.

Have you ever traveled abroad?

​

A.

Yes, I have traveled to Japan twice.

​

My first trip was to Tokyo with my high school friends for 5 days.

​

The second trip was a family trip to Osaka for about 4 days after being discharged from the army.

​

Both experiences were unforgettable memories.

Q.
Tell me about the time you went to Tokyo.

A.

Of course. There are so many stories about when I went to Tokyo with my friends.

I'll tell you about the memories of the first day.

It was our first trip to Japan.

We arrived at Narita Airport well, but it was difficult to find the location of the train to Shin-Okubo Station where the accommodation was located.


It would have taken a lot of time if the kind station staff hadn't taken us to the subway station.

Although we arrived at Shin-Okubo Station, it was difficult to find accommodation.

Because our accommodation was hidden in an alley.

We was able to arrive at the accommodation with the help of local residents.

It would have been nice if the day ended without anything, but my friends were people who caused a lot of problems.

When I came back to the accommodation after dinner, my friend said he lost his shoe rack key.

My friend and I went to look for the keys, while the rest of the friends went to the convenience store to buy drinks and snacks



Fortunately, the restaurant clerk was keeping the key.


The interesting thing was that they were also giving away other lost items besides the keys


Another friend didn't even know his stuff was lost.


We thanked the clerk and returned to the accommodation.

After all that happened, the day ended.
