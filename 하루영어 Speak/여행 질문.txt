Q.

Have you ever traveled abroad?

​

A.

Yes, I have traveled to Japan twice.

​

My first trip was to Tokyo with my high school friends for 5 days.

The second trip was a family trip to Osaka for about 4 days after being discharged from the army.

​

Both experiences were unforgettable memories.


도쿄 여행 이야기 

Q.
Tell me about the time you went to Tokyo.

A.

Of course. There are so many stories about when I went to Tokyo with my friends.

I'll tell you about the memories of the first day.

It was our first trip to Japan.

We arrived at Narita Airport well, but it was difficult to find the location of the train to Shin-Okubo Station where the accommodation was located.


It would have taken a lot of time if the kind station staff hadn't taken us to the subway station.

Although we arrived at Shin-Okubo Station, it was difficult to find accommodation.

Because our accommodation was hidden in an alley.

We was able to arrive at the accommodation with the help of local residents.

It would have been nice if the day ended without anything, but my friends were people who caused a lot of problems.

When I came back to the accommodation after dinner, my friend said he lost his shoe rack key.

My friend and I went to look for the keys, while the rest of the friends went to the convenience store to buy drinks and snacks



Fortunately, the restaurant clerk was keeping the key.


The interesting thing was that they were also giving away other lost items besides the keys


Another friend didn't even know his stuff was lost.


We thanked the clerk and returned to the accommodation.

After all that happened, the day ended.

Q.

We talked about traveling to Japan before.

​

What did you do on the second day?

​

A.

Well, I think I went to the Ueno Zoo and the nearby museum on the second day.

​

I enjoyed looking at the zoo, but the museum I went to because I had time was not fun.

​

I was walking around and I was so sleepy that everyone was resting at the rest stop and left in the middle.

​

I remember finishing the second day and coming back to the accommodation.

Q.

Do you remember traveling to Japan with your friends?

We talked until day two, right?

What did you do on the third day?

​

A.

I see. Um... I don't remember well, but I remember heading to Tokyo Tower on the morning of the 3rd day.

​

I remember doing an animaion "One Piece" collaboration event there and being scared on the glass floor on the top floor.

​

Oh, and I remember buying the Chopper hat of "One Piece" and Tokyo Tower model after the tour.

​

In the afternoon, I remember touring Odaiba in Goto-ku to go to Oedo Onsen

​

There were so many things to see because it was a tourist attraction!!

Fuji TV station, the Statue of Liberty, Gundam, and the automobile museum.

​

When I finished sightseeing, it was evening, so I went to Oedo Onsen to relieve my fatigue.

​

I think it's because We went around a lot, but everyone fell asleep because they were tired in the subway.

​

On the way here, I saw the Rainbow Bridge as a night view and it was really nice.

​

Everyone said that the third day of the trip was the most enjoyable and memorable.
