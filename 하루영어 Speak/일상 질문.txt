Q. Have you seen a movie recently?


A.
Yes, I watched a movie called "Suzume" today.


This movie was made by director Makoto Shinkai based on the Great East Japan Earthquake.

It was a movie with a very good response from people, and it was a movie with a reason.

The reason I decided to watch this movie was because of the positive response from people, and after watching it, I understood why people reacted so positively

I highly recommend going to the theater to watch this movie for those who haven't seen it yet

Q.

What did you do last Sunday?

​

A.

Last Sunday was my grandmother's birthday.

​

So I went to my grandmother's favorite restaurant and had a birthday party.

​

After the birthday party, we talked about how we were doing at my grandmother's house, and we broke up at night.

Q.

Are you getting enough sleep?

Getting enough sleep is very important for your health.

​

​

A.

I agree that getting enough sleep is very important for your health.

​

But I haven't been getting enough sleep lately.

​

The reason is that I work overtime to meet the project schedule I am working on now, and I am not sleeping well because of stress even when I come home.

Q.

What did you do for lunch today?

​

A.

Today, I went to a restaurant called "Crapple."

​

I ordered cheese pork cutlet there.

​

It tasted pretty good.

​

If you visit this restaurant for the first time, please order cheese pork cutlet because it's delicious.


Q.

What did you do today?

​

A.

Today, I went to the reserve army.

​

So I'm very tired right now.

​

I'll stop here for today and go to bed.

Q.

Do you often cook at home?

​

A.

Well, no, I don't make food that can be called cooking.

​

The food I eat often at home is grilled meat... Even if I eat other foods, I only heat up the finished product and eat it.

​

Honestly, I think it's better to heat up the finished product than to cook it myself.

Q.

Where were you born and raised?

​

A.

I was born in Busan but lived in Ulsan before college.

​

I started living in Busan after I was 20 years old when I entered Kyungsung University and lived in a dormitory.

​

Maybe because I moved from a city with nothing, I'm living satisfied.

Q.

Have you been out today? The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

​

A.

Yes, I looked around for a while during lunch time at the company, and a lot of cherry blossoms were in bloom.

​

I can definitely feel that spring has come.

​

I am thinking of going to see the famous cherry blossom spots in Busan this Saturday.

Q.

You said you were going to see cherry blossoms, is there a famous place in Busan?

​

A.

Well, I don't know many places because I don't go around.

​

The place I know is Oncheon Stream near my grandmother's house.

​

Because it is a very famous cherry blossom street, there are many cafes lined up around it and it is a place where many people visit.


Q.

How many years have you been a developer?
​

A.

The total experience is almost three years old.

​

However, if you look at Android experience alone, it will be two years next month.

​

It seems like yesterday when I first joined the company as an Android developer, but time really flies.

Q.

Do you like games?

Is there a game you're looking forward to this time?

​

A.

Yes, I like games.

​

The game I'm looking forward to is "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."

​

I wasn't very good at playing the game Zelda originally, but I became very interested after playing the previous installment, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", which I found extremely enjoyable.

Q.

I heard you're going to see cherry blossoms today. Is that right?

​

A.

Yes, that's right. I met my friend this morning and decided to go to Oncheon Stream.

​

After having lunch with my friend and breaking up, I am going to go to my hometown by subway to Ulsan.

​

I have no plans after that.

Q. How was the cherry blossom viewing today?

​

A.

It wasn't very good

​

This is because most of the cherry blossoms were already fallen.

​

Still, rape flowers were in full bloom in the surrounding rape flower fields, so I watched them well.

Q.

What did you do on the weekend?

​

A.

There was nothing special except seeing cherry blossoms with my friend on Saturday.

​

More than that, I have my sister's wedding next month, and everyone seems to be busy with it.

​

We discussed how to go up from Busan to Seoul next month and where to sleep.

Q.

Maybe because it's spring, there are many times when I'm lost in memories.

Do you have a place to remember?

​

A.

Yes, I remember the neighborhood I lived in when I was in elementary school.

​

Actually, when I was young, my family's economic situation wasn't very good.

​

There were many times when I was sad because of the difficult economic situation.

​

Because of that, my parents hate that neighborhood very much.

​

Because of bad memories.

​

But in such a difficult economic situation, I still miss the memories of the neighborhood because of the help of my neighbors and memories with my friends.

​

So when I visit my home in Ulsan, I often visit the old town by bicycle.

Q.

You said you live in Busan now.

Do you want to move to another area?

A.

To be honest, I don't think Busan is a good city to live in.

​

If I move to a local area, I want to move to Changwon, and if I move to a Gyeonggi area, I want to move to Bucheon

​

I want to avoid places where there are too many people, so I think it's better to live in a planned city of the right size.

Q.

The weekend is coming soon What are you going to do this weekend?

A.

I will go to Shinsegae Department Store in Haeundae this weekend.

​

I'm not going shopping, but I've bought a "Samsonite" brand bag at Shinsegae Department Store before.

​

As I use my bag often, the zipper of my bag was torn off, and I go to the department store to get an A/S for this.

Q.

Which phone do you use between Android and IOS phones?

A.

I am using a Galaxy S23 Ultra cell phone with Android OS.

​

Actually, I want to try the iPhone, but I'm currently developing Android, so I'm continuing to use the Galaxy product line for development convenience.

​

If I have a chance in the future, I'd like to try using an iPhone.

Q.

Did you go to the department store well?

​

A.

Yes, I went to the store and left my bag after-sales service.

​

However, I was surprised because the A/S period was so long.

​

It took me a month to replace a zipper..

There seems to be a bit of a problem with the A/S of "Samsonite."

Q.

Do you have a religion?

A.

No, I don't have a specific religion.

​

I go anywhere regardless of Buddhism or Christianity.

​

I don't think there's only one God in the world.

​

I admire the world's religions that show kindness to their neighbors, and I think there are gods of each religion.

​

Therefore, I hope you respect each other's faith instead of criticizing it.

Q.

It's been 30 days since I started the English challenge today!

​

It's good to see you keep trying.

A.

Oh, thank you.

​

But I don't feel that my English has improved much yet.

​

However, if I continue to challenge myself, I will expect my English skills to improve.

Q.

The yellow dust seems to be too severe these days.

​

A.

That's right.

I can't ventilate often because of the yellow dust.

And the air in the office is very dry.

​

For this reason, the air is so stuffy and my head hurts a lot these days.

Please take care of your health.

﻿
Q.

Is there something wrong with your health?


A.

My eyes hurt a lot these days.


I don't know if it's because I'm tired or dry.


I'll stop here and go to sleep.

Q.

You're currently using Java, are you interested in switching to another language?

​

A.

Yes, I am planning to change my language to Kotlin in the future.

​

Kotlin is now an essential language for Android development.

​

All the new features that are currently being developed are libraries for Kotlin.

​

So I don't think there's much advantage in continuing to use Java.

Q.

Is there a new restaurant you found?

A.

Yes, I recently found a sushi restaurant near my house, one of my favorite foods.

​

The advantage of this restaurant is that it only takes about 5 minutes from my studio apartment.

​

The price is also 11000\, which is not too much to buy often, so I use it often.

Q.

Trying to reverse your sleep pattern?

​

A.

Yes, I have tried to reverse my sleep pattern since last Saturday.

​

I had a hard time holding back my sleep over coffee on Sunday, but I eventually managed to change my sleep pattern.

​

So now, I sleep before 2 o'clock and guarantee a minimum of 6 hours of sleep.

​

The goal is to ensure a minimum of 7 hours of sleep.

Q.

The weather is very bad these days.

A.

That's right. A few weeks ago, the weather was like spring

I think the weather is already summer these days

​

It's already hot and humid, so I think my condition is the worst.

​

I hope the weather gets better again.

Q.

It's too hot today, isn't it?

​

A.

That's right. I wore a coat to work today, but I regretted it because it was so hot.

​

When I arrived at the company, my whole body was covered with sweat, so I don't know how many minutes I spent just cooling off my sweat.

​

From tomorrow, I'll wear the least clothes and go to work.

Q.

Tomorrow is the weekend. Do you have any plans for the weekend?

​

A.

Yes, I decided to go to the department store with my family on Sunday.

​

Because my sister's wedding is next month, so I have to buy a suit to wear at the wedding.

​

Other than that, I don't have any other plans.

Q.

How are you feeling these days?

​

A.

Very good.

​

These days, my lifestyle has come back, so it has become a habit to go to bed early and wake up early.

​

Even on weekends, I wake up early and start my day, so I feel like I'm spending a lot of time.

​

I hope this continues in the future.
