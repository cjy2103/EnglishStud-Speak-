Q. Have you seen a movie recently?


A.
Yes, I watched a movie called "Suzume" today.


This movie was made by director Makoto Shinkai based on the Great East Japan Earthquake.

It was a movie with a very good response from people, and it was a movie with a reason.

The reason I decided to watch this movie was because of the positive response from people, and after watching it, I understood why people reacted so positively

I highly recommend going to the theater to watch this movie for those who haven't seen it yet

Q.

What did you do last Sunday?

​

A.

Last Sunday was my grandmother's birthday.

​

So I went to my grandmother's favorite restaurant and had a birthday party.

​

After the birthday party, we talked about how we were doing at my grandmother's house, and we broke up at night.
