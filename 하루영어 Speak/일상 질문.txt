Q. Have you seen a movie recently?


A.
Yes, I watched a movie called "Suzume" today.


This movie was made by director Makoto Shinkai based on the Great East Japan Earthquake.

It was a movie with a very good response from people, and it was a movie with a reason.

The reason I decided to watch this movie was because of the positive response from people, and after watching it, I understood why people reacted so positively

I highly recommend going to the theater to watch this movie for those who haven't seen it yet

Q.

What did you do last Sunday?

​

A.

Last Sunday was my grandmother's birthday.

​

So I went to my grandmother's favorite restaurant and had a birthday party.

​

After the birthday party, we talked about how we were doing at my grandmother's house, and we broke up at night.

Q.

Are you getting enough sleep?

Getting enough sleep is very important for your health.

​

​

A.

I agree that getting enough sleep is very important for your health.

​

But I haven't been getting enough sleep lately.

​

The reason is that I work overtime to meet the project schedule I am working on now, and I am not sleeping well because of stress even when I come home.

Q.

What did you do for lunch today?

​

A.

Today, I went to a restaurant called "Crapple."

​

I ordered cheese pork cutlet there.

​

It tasted pretty good.

​

If you visit this restaurant for the first time, please order cheese pork cutlet because it's delicious.


Q.

What did you do today?

​

A.

Today, I went to the reserve army.

​

So I'm very tired right now.

​

I'll stop here for today and go to bed.

Q.

Do you often cook at home?

​

A.

Well, no, I don't make food that can be called cooking.

​

The food I eat often at home is grilled meat... Even if I eat other foods, I only heat up the finished product and eat it.

​

Honestly, I think it's better to heat up the finished product than to cook it myself.

Q.

Where were you born and raised?

​

A.

I was born in Busan but lived in Ulsan before college.

​

I started living in Busan after I was 20 years old when I entered Kyungsung University and lived in a dormitory.

​

Maybe because I moved from a city with nothing, I'm living satisfied.

Q.

Have you been out today? The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

​

A.

Yes, I looked around for a while during lunch time at the company, and a lot of cherry blossoms were in bloom.

​

I can definitely feel that spring has come.

​

I am thinking of going to see the famous cherry blossom spots in Busan this Saturday.

Q.

You said you were going to see cherry blossoms, is there a famous place in Busan?

​

A.

Well, I don't know many places because I don't go around.

​

The place I know is Oncheon Stream near my grandmother's house.

​

Because it is a very famous cherry blossom street, there are many cafes lined up around it and it is a place where many people visit.


Q.

How many years have you been a developer?
​

A.

The total experience is almost three years old.

​

However, if you look at Android experience alone, it will be two years next month.

​

It seems like yesterday when I first joined the company as an Android developer, but time really flies.

Q.

Do you like games?

Is there a game you're looking forward to this time?

​

A.

Yes, I like games.

​

The game I'm looking forward to is "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."

​

I wasn't very good at playing the game Zelda originally, but I became very interested after playing the previous installment, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", which I found extremely enjoyable.

Q.

I heard you're going to see cherry blossoms today. Is that right?

​

A.

Yes, that's right. I met my friend this morning and decided to go to Oncheon Stream.

​

After having lunch with my friend and breaking up, I am going to go to my hometown by subway to Ulsan.

​

I have no plans after that.

Q. How was the cherry blossom viewing today?

​

A.

It wasn't very good

​

This is because most of the cherry blossoms were already fallen.

​

Still, rape flowers were in full bloom in the surrounding rape flower fields, so I watched them well.

Q.

What did you do on the weekend?

​

A.

There was nothing special except seeing cherry blossoms with my friend on Saturday.

​

More than that, I have my sister's wedding next month, and everyone seems to be busy with it.

​

We discussed how to go up from Busan to Seoul next month and where to sleep.

Q.

Maybe because it's spring, there are many times when I'm lost in memories.

Do you have a place to remember?

​

A.

Yes, I remember the neighborhood I lived in when I was in elementary school.

​

Actually, when I was young, my family's economic situation wasn't very good.

​

There were many times when I was sad because of the difficult economic situation.

​

Because of that, my parents hate that neighborhood very much.

​

Because of bad memories.

​

But in such a difficult economic situation, I still miss the memories of the neighborhood because of the help of my neighbors and memories with my friends.

​

So when I visit my home in Ulsan, I often visit the old town by bicycle.

Q.

You said you live in Busan now.

Do you want to move to another area?

A.

To be honest, I don't think Busan is a good city to live in.

​

If I move to a local area, I want to move to Changwon, and if I move to a Gyeonggi area, I want to move to Bucheon

​

I want to avoid places where there are too many people, so I think it's better to live in a planned city of the right size.

Q.

The weekend is coming soon What are you going to do this weekend?

A.

I will go to Shinsegae Department Store in Haeundae this weekend.

​

I'm not going shopping, but I've bought a "Samsonite" brand bag at Shinsegae Department Store before.

​

As I use my bag often, the zipper of my bag was torn off, and I go to the department store to get an A/S for this.

Q.

Which phone do you use between Android and IOS phones?

A.

I am using a Galaxy S23 Ultra cell phone with Android OS.

​

Actually, I want to try the iPhone, but I'm currently developing Android, so I'm continuing to use the Galaxy product line for development convenience.

​

If I have a chance in the future, I'd like to try using an iPhone.

Q.

Did you go to the department store well?

​

A.

Yes, I went to the store and left my bag after-sales service.

​

However, I was surprised because the A/S period was so long.

​

It took me a month to replace a zipper..

There seems to be a bit of a problem with the A/S of "Samsonite."

Q.

Do you have a religion?

A.

No, I don't have a specific religion.

​

I go anywhere regardless of Buddhism or Christianity.

​

I don't think there's only one God in the world.

​

I admire the world's religions that show kindness to their neighbors, and I think there are gods of each religion.

​

Therefore, I hope you respect each other's faith instead of criticizing it.

Q.

It's been 30 days since I started the English challenge today!

​

It's good to see you keep trying.

A.

Oh, thank you.

​

But I don't feel that my English has improved much yet.

​

However, if I continue to challenge myself, I will expect my English skills to improve.

Q.

The yellow dust seems to be too severe these days.

​

A.

That's right.

I can't ventilate often because of the yellow dust.

And the air in the office is very dry.

​

For this reason, the air is so stuffy and my head hurts a lot these days.

Please take care of your health.

﻿
Q.

Is there something wrong with your health?


A.

My eyes hurt a lot these days.


I don't know if it's because I'm tired or dry.


I'll stop here and go to sleep.

Q.

You're currently using Java, are you interested in switching to another language?

​

A.

Yes, I am planning to change my language to Kotlin in the future.

​

Kotlin is now an essential language for Android development.

​

All the new features that are currently being developed are libraries for Kotlin.

​

So I don't think there's much advantage in continuing to use Java.

Q.

Is there a new restaurant you found?

A.

Yes, I recently found a sushi restaurant near my house, one of my favorite foods.

​

The advantage of this restaurant is that it only takes about 5 minutes from my studio apartment.

​

The price is also 11000\, which is not too much to buy often, so I use it often.

Q.

Trying to reverse your sleep pattern?

​

A.

Yes, I have tried to reverse my sleep pattern since last Saturday.

​

I had a hard time holding back my sleep over coffee on Sunday, but I eventually managed to change my sleep pattern.

​

So now, I sleep before 2 o'clock and guarantee a minimum of 6 hours of sleep.

​

The goal is to ensure a minimum of 7 hours of sleep.

Q.

The weather is very bad these days.

A.

That's right. A few weeks ago, the weather was like spring

I think the weather is already summer these days

​

It's already hot and humid, so I think my condition is the worst.

​

I hope the weather gets better again.

Q.

It's too hot today, isn't it?

​

A.

That's right. I wore a coat to work today, but I regretted it because it was so hot.

​

When I arrived at the company, my whole body was covered with sweat, so I don't know how many minutes I spent just cooling off my sweat.

​

From tomorrow, I'll wear the least clothes and go to work.

Q.

Tomorrow is the weekend. Do you have any plans for the weekend?

​

A.

Yes, I decided to go to the department store with my family on Sunday.

​

Because my sister's wedding is next month, so I have to buy a suit to wear at the wedding.

​

Other than that, I don't have any other plans.

Q.

How are you feeling these days?

​

A.

Very good.

​

These days, my lifestyle has come back, so it has become a habit to go to bed early and wake up early.

​

Even on weekends, I wake up early and start my day, so I feel like I'm spending a lot of time.

​

I hope this continues in the future.

Q.

Did you buy the weekend suit well?

​

A.

Yes, and I heard that my brother, who I used to play with when I was young, is getting married this week.

​

Well, I don't know how much I'm going to pay

​

We were really close when we were young. After I became a middle school student and moved, I thought we didn't contact each other

Q.

Are you very busy at work?

A.

Yes, I am very busy because the app is distributed in a few days.

​

Currently, the functions are almost complete and we are conducting a bug test.

​

I'm in a very tight state because YouTube only gives me a month of grace due to various security policy updates.

Q.

Did you find a new restaurant?

A.

That's right. I found a new pork cutlet restaurant yesterday.

​

Originally, I was going to go to another pork cutlet restaurant, but it was so famous that I decided to go somewhere else because of the number of people waiting.

​

The director took me to a pork cutlet restaurant near my old school and it was a really good restaurant.

​Q.

What happened at work yesterday?

​

A.

The location of the company's furniture has been moved to the whole.

​

The director moved the whole place to the entrance together when there were no people because he didn't like the current arrangement.

​

I don't think it's bad as a result.

​

I feel like the development department has been divided by the relocation of the furniture.

​

It's good because it seems to be divided into people who only do mobile and people who do embedded.




The restaurant was located deep in the residential area, so it was hard to find, but I was surprised that I didn't know such a good restaurant when I was a college student.

Q.

It's a three-day holiday from today Do you have any specific plans?

​

A.

No, I don't have any plans after my acquaintance's wedding on Sunday.

​

I don't know if I'll come back to Busan right after the wedding or the next day

​

If I return on Monday, I think I will stop by the company and fix the bug.

Q.

Did you go to the wedding hall well?

​

A.

Yes, it felt a little strange to hear that my brother who played with me when I was young was getting married.

​

And a few weeks later, at my sister's wedding, I saw what I had to do.

​

It was a day that made me think a lot of thoughts.

Q.

What did you do on Labor Day?

​

A.

I worked for a while in the morning.

​

The app version that I distributed before was also bugged a lot.

​

I corrected some errors in advance to work comfortably the next day.

​

In the afternoon, I took a rest while cleaning the house.


Q.

Is there something special going on?

​

A.

No, it's a continuation of normal daily life.

​

I'm done with my urgent work and I'm in a very relaxed state now.

​

I'm going to study what I usually planned while I'm free.

Q.

It's a holiday again from tomorrow. What are you going to do this week?

​

A.

I am thinking of going down to Ulsan for Parents' Day this week.

​

I will eat at a restaurant with my parents and look around the nearby tourist attractions.

​

And I'm going to go back to Busan on Sunday.

Q.

The holiday starts today, but the weather is not good.

​

A.

Yes, it has been raining too much since yesterday.

​

I can't go anywhere at this rate.

​

If the weather is not good until tomorrow, I will just read a book or study at home.

Q.

Did you have a good Children's Day?

​

A.

It rained, but I had a good time.

​

Before it rained in the morning, I quickly went to a flower shop, bought carnations, and gave them to my parents while eating in the afternoon.

​

After eating, I stopped by to say hello when I heard that all my relatives were gathered at my aunt's house.

​

It was 11 p.m. when I got home after all the schedules.

Q.

What did you do yesterday?

​

A.

I stayed at home all day yesterday because of the rain.

​

And I got a perm at home during that time.

​

It seemed awkward because I wasn't used to perm my hair, but the rest of the family said that I think it went well and that I should have permed it earlier.

Q.

The job market seems to be too icy these days.

​

A.

Right, especially the Android development I'm working on seems to be worse.

​

There are many reasons, but first of all, the demand for Android positions has fallen a lot compared to other positions, and the IT bubble seems to have burst after Corona.

​

For this reason, people around me often say that it is difficult to change jobs.

Q.

Are you interested in buying a car?

​

A.

Yes, I am thinking of buying a used car after my birthday in a few months.

​

Originally, I was going to buy a new car.

​

But recently, the development of electric vehicles has grown rapidly, and there have been many low-cost electric vehicles, so I wondered if it was right to buy an internal combustion engine car for a high price.

​

So I'm thinking of buying a used car and driving it for a few years and then buying a new electric car.

Q.

The price of bread seems to be too high these days.

A.

That's right.

​

I stopped by a bakery because I wanted to eat bread after a long time, and the price went up a lot.

​

At times like this, I'm kind of jealous of the neighboring country, Japan.

​

The bread size is big and the price is reasonable there.

Q.

Did you know that Zelda's new title has been released?

​

A.

Honestly, I had no idea.

​

I happened to hear yesterday that Zelda's new title was released and sold.

​

So I bought a new title on the Internet in a hurry..

I don't know when the delivery will be.

​

It said that the expected arrival date is this Saturday.

​

The new popular titles will be sold out soon, so I don't know if they will come on time.

Q.

Everyone was playing the tears of the kingdom of Zelda, did the product I ordered arrive?

​

A.

Yes, when I woke up today, the delivery came

​

To be honest, I thought I wouldn't be able to play on the weekend because of Zelda's popularity and late delivery application... I'm so happy that it's delivered so quickly.

​

I want to play right now, but I have work to do, so I'm going to play after dinner.

﻿
Q.

How was it playing the tears of Zelda Kingdom delivered yesterday?


A.

I did it before I went to bed yesterday, and it was really fun.


I heard that if you have high expectations, you may be disappointed, but this was worth it.


The follow-up seems to have been successful, seeing that the evaluation continues to be very positive.


﻿Q. 

Are you tired today?

​

A.

Yes, I started exercising yesterday, such as going around the park on my way home from work.

​

Maybe it's because I walked a lot, but I think my legs are a little stiff.

​

As soon as I came home from exercise, I fell asleep because I was tired.

​

And yet, I think I still have leg fatigue.

​

Next time, I should stretch a little before exercising.

Q.

I heard that it will continue to rain in July except for about four days. Do you believe this?

​

A.

No, I honestly don't believe it.

​

No matter how advanced technology is, I don't think we can predict the climate two months later.

​

And even though it is the rainy season, it is not credible to say that it will rain continuously except for four days in July.

​
Q.

I think mosquitoes are already going around.

​

A.

That's right. That's terrible.

​

I got bitten by mosquitoes a few times at home yesterday.

​

Fortunately, I found a few mosquitoes before going to bed and caught them, so it didn't interfere with my sleep.

Q.

Thank you for your hard work this week. Tomorrow is the weekend.

​

A.

It's already the weekend. I was too busy this week.

​

I don't remember how I spent this week at work.

​

I can't wait to go home and relax.

Q.

You've been taking a walk after work, is there a problem?

​

A.

Actually, there's a big problem.

​

Maybe it's because I don't have enough stamina, but I'm so tired that I fall asleep as soon as I get home.

​

Because of that, I am not studying well after work.

​

I think that's the problem.
