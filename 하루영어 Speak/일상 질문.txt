Q. Have you seen a movie recently?


A.
Yes, I watched a movie called "Suzume" today.


This movie was made by director Makoto Shinkai based on the Great East Japan Earthquake.

It was a movie with a very good response from people, and it was a movie with a reason.

The reason I decided to watch this movie was because of the positive response from people, and after watching it, I understood why people reacted so positively

I highly recommend going to the theater to watch this movie for those who haven't seen it yet

Q.

What did you do last Sunday?

​

A.

Last Sunday was my grandmother's birthday.

​

So I went to my grandmother's favorite restaurant and had a birthday party.

​

After the birthday party, we talked about how we were doing at my grandmother's house, and we broke up at night.

Q.

Are you getting enough sleep?

Getting enough sleep is very important for your health.

​

​

A.

I agree that getting enough sleep is very important for your health.

​

But I haven't been getting enough sleep lately.

​

The reason is that I work overtime to meet the project schedule I am working on now, and I am not sleeping well because of stress even when I come home.

Q.

What did you do for lunch today?

​

A.

Today, I went to a restaurant called "Crapple."

​

I ordered cheese pork cutlet there.

​

It tasted pretty good.

​

If you visit this restaurant for the first time, please order cheese pork cutlet because it's delicious.


Q.

What did you do today?

​

A.

Today, I went to the reserve army.

​

So I'm very tired right now.

​

I'll stop here for today and go to bed.

Q.

Do you often cook at home?

​

A.

Well, no, I don't make food that can be called cooking.

​

The food I eat often at home is grilled meat... Even if I eat other foods, I only heat up the finished product and eat it.

​

Honestly, I think it's better to heat up the finished product than to cook it myself.

Q.

Where were you born and raised?

​

A.

I was born in Busan but lived in Ulsan before college.

​

I started living in Busan after I was 20 years old when I entered Kyungsung University and lived in a dormitory.

​

Maybe because I moved from a city with nothing, I'm living satisfied.

Q.

Have you been out today? The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

​

A.

Yes, I looked around for a while during lunch time at the company, and a lot of cherry blossoms were in bloom.

​

I can definitely feel that spring has come.

​

I am thinking of going to see the famous cherry blossom spots in Busan this Saturday.

Q.

You said you were going to see cherry blossoms, is there a famous place in Busan?

​

A.

Well, I don't know many places because I don't go around.

​

The place I know is Oncheon Stream near my grandmother's house.

​

Because it is a very famous cherry blossom street, there are many cafes lined up around it and it is a place where many people visit.


Q.

How many years have you been a developer?
​

A.

The total experience is almost three years old.

​

However, if you look at Android experience alone, it will be two years next month.

​

It seems like yesterday when I first joined the company as an Android developer, but time really flies.

Q.

Do you like games?

Is there a game you're looking forward to this time?

​

A.

Yes, I like games.

​

The game I'm looking forward to is "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."

​

I wasn't very good at playing the game Zelda originally, but I became very interested after playing the previous installment, "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", which I found extremely enjoyable.
