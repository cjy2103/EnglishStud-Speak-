Q. Have you seen a movie recently?


A.
Yes, I watched a movie called "Suzume" today.


This movie was made by director Makoto Shinkai based on the Great East Japan Earthquake.

It was a movie with a very good response from people, and it was a movie with a reason.

The reason I decided to watch this movie was because of the positive response from people, and after watching it, I understood why people reacted so positively

I highly recommend going to the theater to watch this movie for those who haven't seen it yet
